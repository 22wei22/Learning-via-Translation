**Paper**: Image-Image Domain Adaptation with Preserved Self-Similarity and Domain-Dissimilarity for Person Re-identification (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07027.pdf)

Tensorflow implementation of Similarity Preserving cycleconsistent Generative Adversarial Network ([SPGAN](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1711.07027.pdf)), mostly modified from https://github.com/LynnHo/CycleGAN-Tensorflow-PyTorch-Simple. Thank you for your kindly attention.
